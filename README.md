# PHP_Ecommercewebsite_beginner_with_db
This is an e-commerce website designed with the implementation of HTML, BOOTSTRAP, AND PHP using dynamic data from the database PhpAdmin.
It is a beginner project using a PHP database connection.
I have learned how to take dynamic data from a database but before you have to create a database and create a connection with your php file.
Once you have established a connection create a table 'clothes' for examples and insert data in it. Make sure you have a unique and not null id for every item.
Design your layout for the e-commerce website and fetch your data from the database to display on the screen.
